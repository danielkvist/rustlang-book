// A crate is a binary or library.
//
// A package is one or more crates that provides
// a set of functionality.
//
// A module let us organize code within a crate into
// groups for readability and easy reuse. They also
// control the privacy of items.
//
// By default in Rust all items (functions, methods, structs,
// enums, modules and constants) are private. To expose
// them you can use the pub keyword to make an item public.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
